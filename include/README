ESPNTP

This is a simple code for ESP8266-based devices with Arduino Core. The purpose is to show how to use the
Arduino Esp-librarys built in NTP-function the get the current time from the internet.
Most projects that gets correct time from the internet uses an external library, but
that's not necessary. The project is written in Atom/PlatformIO but should be possible to use in other
IDE:s like the Arduino IDE.
We have three source files. "connect.cpp" has the code to connect to WiFi. It uses settings found in
"settings.h". This makes it possible to publish the code but exclude the secret WiFi password.
"ntp.c" includes the functions to configure and use a NTP-server.
Finally there is "main.cpp" with the code to set everything up, call the relevant functions and
print out the correct time to the serial port.
